Survival Prediction of the algorithm

Titanic ,one of the biggest tragedies of the world is an event known to everyone. Well , my next project deals with the information related to this queen of the seas. My algorithm analyses various data features and predicts which person could have survived the disaster and who couldn't. It has been trained on a training set and various models have been used to compare the prediction accuracy out of which the best-performing model has been deployed.
